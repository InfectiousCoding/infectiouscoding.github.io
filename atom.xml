    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Intro (<a href="#silence">skip</a>)</h2>

<p>It happens that a lot of us have to work in an office environment.
And it also happens that an office can be quiet noisy sometimes.</p>

<p>In my case the work place is so loud that it impedes my work a lot.
Just imagine that someone decided to put a server room next to sys-admins next to developers next to designers.
As a result we are all crammed into one huge room that splits into sections.</p>

<p>It would not be such a big deal if not for the noise in the office:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every couple of minutes a new conversation takes place between people.
  (Sometimes its a week-long battle between group of sys admins on various topics)</li>
<li>Someone decides that it is good to turn the music on. Blast it with speakers, yay!</li>
<li>Calls are coming in once in a while.</li>
<li>People always are walking in and out of office slamming the door behind.
  (Sometimes they carry carts full of hardware.)</li>
<li>Someone fills-in a bottle/cup of water at a water fountain.</li>
<li>Someone is printing what looks like a &ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo;-thick book.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a lunch time and people start calling local restaurants and dictate their orders over the phone. In office.</li>
<li>Designer laughs at some video.
  (I am sure it&rsquo;s a funny, but it does not make my problems go away)</li>
<li>Someone is coughing all day.
  (It&rsquo;s winter time and people get sick, I get it)</li>
</ul>


<p>So the only time office gets calm is at 9 am (when no one is in yet) and at 1 pm (since everyone leaves for lunch).</p>

<p>And like that is not enough, by 6 pm (we are working 9-6) sys-admins start chat roulette to talk to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Pretty much you cannot help the situation and to get any work done you have to work in headphones.
And so I did work in them.
For over a year that was fine.
But time takes its toll and I started noticing that even that was not enough for me. I could not:</p>

<ol>
<li>listen to deafen mumble all day</li>
<li>increase the volume because music was getting too loud</li>
<li>even listening to <a href="http://www.rainymood.com/">RainyMood</a> or <a href="http://simplynoise.com/">SimplyNoise</a> on higher pitch was becoming painful</li>
</ol>


<p>Sometimes you will fall into a stupor and have to make an effort to concentrate on a task and move on.</p>

<p><a name="silence"></a></p>

<h2>Path to Silence</h2>

<p>First the idea how to achieve silence was to get a pair of plain old earmuffs.
At that time I was naive to think that I would not need a serious protection.
I thought that I could settle for an in-ear headphones :]
But, as it turned out, you need a little bit more than that.</p>

<p>At that time I found <a href="http://www.surefire.com/">SureFire</a>&rsquo;s hearing tactical protection.
Long story short I have experimented with them for awhile and purchased models EP4, EP5, EP7.</p>

<p>SureFire&rsquo;s hearing protection line of products is great, and I am lucky that I have spotted them.
The big problem is that these guys have to be sturdy enough to last you for a long time.
Problem is that you lose them fast. Due to both wear and since I sleep in them
And the EP7 have a cushion that would rip apart within a week.</p>

<p>But the real gem is the <em>EP9 model</em> that I decided to give a go later. (~ $12)
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRX73cJMmpoJ62nNGilxjaoU6rJBjnKhGc97FFDGS_7NjoVH40C" width="280" alt="SureFire EP9" /><br/>
I still wear them to work, and it&rsquo;s have been for more than a year.
And I also sleep in them.
Close to 5 days in a week.
And its much harder to lose them for their acidic blue color.</p>

<p>But after a day in the office I realized that <em>I could still hear all the conversations</em>,
although they definitely became deafen.</p>

<p>So I needed a higher caliber weapon.</p>

<p>There were two choices on the market at this point:</p>

<ul>
<li>active noise cancellation headphones</li>
<li>over-the-ear headphones</li>
</ul>


<p>First option was not for me, because I wanted complete silence.
Moreover I don&rsquo;t know how damaging ANC might be. Plain old headphones sounds more like a natural/healthier choice.</p>

<p>And if you do search online Peltor Optime 105 come up in the results pretty often.<br/>
<img src="http://www.staples-3p.com/s7/is/image/Staples/s0179068_sc7?$splssku$" height="200" width="200" alt="Peltor" />  <br/>
I decided to buy these, since they had good reviews as well as the cheap price. (~ $20)</p>

<p>These headphones fit pretty well, and can adjust to different head sizes.
The problem with them is that although they sure do deafen sound, it is still to the similar extend as the in-ear ones.</p>

<p>And for me this is not enough.</p>

<p>But I decided to combine the two and that turned out to be fantastic.
Now, when I am at work I put on both EP9 and Optime 105 and &hellip; I hear nothing!
All the phone calls, conversations &ndash; just gone.
Now, when someone starts talking too loud I could still hear some mumble in background.
In such situations I just put regular in-ear headphones as well as Optima 105 and listen to some music.
Even the low volume is enough to enjoy the silence from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>And funny enough people now either have to pat you in the shoulder or send you n email/chat.
When boss is standing next to me and tries to speak of something, I have no clue that he is there.</p>

<p>That is pretty scary silence, but I can manage that :)</p>

<p>For everyone who enjoys silence I recommend combining over-ear-muffs with in-ear headphones.</p>

    <id>http://InfectiousCoding.github.io/blog/2013/09/04/add-font-awesome-to-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/danielres/3157685">This gist</a> together with <a href="http://avivkiss.com/blog/2013/03/03/using-font-awesome-with-octopress-how-to/">this post</a> and <a href="http://nesterchung.github.io/blog/2013/05/23/use-font-awesome-on-octopress/">this post</a> explaining how to add Font Awesome to Octopress just does not work :[</p>

<p>Here are precise steps you have to take to make Font Awesome work.</p>

<p><i class="icon-flag icon-2"></i></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Download <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/" title="Font Awesome">Font Awesome</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Extract contents :p</p></li>
<li><p>Copy <code>font-awesome/scss</code> contents to  <code>OctoBlog/sass/font-awesome</code>
so it becomes <code>OctoBlog/sass/font-awesome/scss</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Open <code>OctoBlog/sass/screen.scss</code> and add the line:
<code>@import "font-awesome/scss/font-awesome.scss";</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy <code>font-awesome/font</code> folder to <code>OctoBlog/source</code>
so it becomes <code>OctoBlog/source/font</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Save files that you have modified.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you can use Font Awesome! Just add any icon like so:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>&lt;i class="fa fa-flag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; fa-flag</code>   (Font Awesome V 4+)</li>
<li><code>&lt;i class="icon-flag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; icon-flag</code>  (Font Awesome V 3.2.1-)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Hit <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>F5</code> to refresh the page and cache.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>P.S.</p>

<p>You can also use <code>font-awesome/css</code> instead of scss as an alternative. Good luck!</p>

    <updated>2013-09-04T01:21:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://InfectiousCoding.github.io/blog/2013/09/04/first-time-running-raspberry-pi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a simple guide to setup Raspberry Pi.
For more advanced and detailed support you can try <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Beginners" title="RPi Beginners Guide">the RPi Beginners guide</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>To work with raspberry pi, you most likely would need:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Raspberry Pi :p</p>

<p>You can get it on <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;DEPA=0&amp;Order=BESTMATCH&amp;Description=raspberry+pi&amp;N=-1&amp;isNodeId=1" title="Newegg: Raspberry Pi">Newegg</a> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SQQF9C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=lifehackeramzn--20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009SQQF9C" title="Amazon: Raspberry Pi">Amazon</a> | <a href="http://www.alliedelec.com/lp/120626raso" title="Allied Electronics: Raspberry Pi">Allied Electronics</a> | <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/998" title="Adafruit: Raspberry Pi">Adafruit</a>.
You can also try buying a full <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/1014" title="Adafruit: Raspberry Pi kit">kit at Adafruit</a>.
<em>Take model B (newer), with or without case (it&rsquo;s up to you).</em></p></li>
<li><p>SD card/ micro SD card with SD adapter.</p>

<p>Anything >= 8 gigs should do</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=40000068%20600006226%20600082443&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Description=micro%20SD&amp;name=Class%2010&amp;Order=BESTMATCH" title="Newegg: SD cards">microSDs, Speed Class 10, 8Gbs</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course we have to keep in mind that SD memory is not designed to be used so often as hard drives. The SD lifespan, which depends on amount of read/write operations, is much shorter than the other general type of memory. But the rule for SD cards is that the bigger the size of SD memory, the longer SD card will live. But of course you would want to get the card with <strong>good speed rating</strong>. My suggestion is to take 16 GB or more SD card with speed rating of 10. I use <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100007796%2050001404%20600082443&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;bop=And&amp;Order=RATING&amp;PageSize=20" title="Newegg: SanDisk High Speed SD cards">a SanDisk SD card</a> and so far like it a lot for speed and size.</p></li>
<li><p>USB reader for SD cards.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=-1&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Description=USB%20Card%20Reader%2FWriter%20For%20SD&amp;bop=And&amp;Order=RATING&amp;PageSize=20" title="Newegg: USB Reader standalone">You can get it separately</a>  or <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820161590" title="Newegg: USB Reader with SD card">together with an SD card</a>.</p>

<p><em>A lot of laptops nowadays has a SD slot so reader is not that necessary.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Wireless internet adapter.</p></li>
</ul>


<p> <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833315091&amp;Tpk=ew-7811Un" title="Newegg: Edimax wireless adapter">Edimax EW-7811</a> &ndash; a tiny device, but gives a good speed connection</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833166056" title="Newegg: Rosewill wireless adapter">Rosewill RNX-N180UBE</a> &ndash; a little bigger alternative</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=40000026%20600000004&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Tpk=usb%20hub" title="Newegg: USB hub">USB hub</a>.</p>

<p>If you want more than 2 USB devices connected. For me this is vital, because I need to connect Wi-Fi adapter, keyboard, mouse and a flash drive to Raspberry. A best option is to take hub that is powered over USB. Reason being is that if you want to switch components (plug or unplug USB devices), your Raspberry pi would not reboot. USB Hub provides enough voltage for those devices. On the other hand if you unplug device that is connected straight to the USB port of Raspberry, the voltage spike may occur, causing Pi to reboot :[</p></li>
<li><p>Wired USB keyboard/mouse.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823126097" title="Newegg: Logitech wired keyboard + mice">This Logitech mouse &amp; keyboard should do</a>.</p>

<p><em>Not all wireless keyboards/mice would work perfect enough with Rapsberry Pi. In fact the wireless keyboard that I used worked so badly that I had to type in pi/raspberry login combination up to 10 times :s On the other hand wireless mouse gave me no trouble, but who knows&hellip;</em></p></li>
<li><p>microUSB cable.</p>

<p><em>Most of you have it already, but if someone don&rsquo;t <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=-1&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Description=microusb%20cable&amp;bop=And&amp;Order=RATING&amp;PageSize=20" title="Newegg: microUSB cables">here are a few</a>.
Make sure it is at least 700mA (0.7A) at 5V. If cable provides less power &ndash; it just won&rsquo;t work.</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.newegg.com/HDMI-Cables/SubCategory/ID-2809?Tid=16863&amp;cm_sp=Cables197-_-VisNav-_-HDMI%20Cables&amp;Tpk=hdmi%20cable&amp;Order=RATING" title="Newegg: HDMI cables">HDMI cable</a> to connect to your monitor.</p>

<p><em>Make sure monitor has an HDMI input. When first working with raspberry pi keep in mind that some monitors will have hard time recognizing raspberry pi. <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=34061" title="HDMI connection issue">Here sshipway explains the issue</a>. It happened to me on a new ASUS monitor and I had to find another monitor to make it work.
Additionally if you choose HDMI cable, keep in mind that it carries sound, so you will have one less problem to worry about. :]</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Network-Ethernet-Cables/SubCategory/ID-2825?Tid=16774&amp;Tpk=internet%20cable" title="Newegg: Ethernet cable">Ethernet cable</a>.</p>

<p><em>Depends on whether or not you want to connect yours with a cable. You can easily setup a wireless connection on Raspberry Pi</em></p></li>
<li><p>Possibly <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835200042" title="Newegg: Heat sink">a heat sink</a>.</p>

<p><em>Not that it is &ldquo;a must have&rdquo;, but pi can get pretty hot (Got it? Oh, yeah&hellip;). Any old heat sink would do. Putting pi in front of fan would be just as fine :p</em></p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is a basic hardware setup for a raspberry pi.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now let&rsquo;s go to software! :p</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Beginners" title="RPi Beginners Guide">RPi Beginners</a> &ndash; this will guide you through both the hardware and software.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Using_NOOBS" title="NOOBS: Easy Setup">SD Card easy setup &ndash; N.O.O.B.S.</a> &ndash;
This is a great instruction set on how to get Raspberry Pi up and running.</p></li>
<li><p>NOOBS: <a href="http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/images/NOOBS/NOOBS_v1_2_1/NOOBS_v1_2_1.zip" title="NOOBS: Direct Link">Direct Link</a> | <a href="http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/images/NOOBS/NOOBS_v1_2_1/NOOBS_v1_2_1.zip.torrent" title="NOOBS: Torrent">Torrent Link</a></p></li>
<li><p>SD Card Formatter: <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/eula_windows/SDFormatterv4exe.zip" title="SD formatter: Direct Link">Direct Link</a></p></li>
<li><p>After copying NOOBS to your SD card, plug it into Raspberry Pi and boot up!</p></li>
</ul>


<p> <em>Remember to choose a different monitor for Raspberry Pi if it does not work from the start</em>.</p>

<p>  If you see nothing, try to hit <code>2</code> on keyboard and wait for a few seconds. If you see nothing &ndash; try other monitor. Does not help? <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=34061" title="HDMI connection issue">Here is another take on this problem</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>What OS should I install?</li>
</ul>


<p> &ldquo;RECOMMENDED&rdquo; or &ldquo;Raspbian&rdquo; options are a good choice :p
 <br /></p>

<ul>
<li><p>After Raspbian is installed it will ask you to login. Your default username/password is pi/raspberry . Type in <code>pi</code>. Hit Enter. There will be a prompt for password. Type in <code>raspberry</code>. Hit Enter. If you fail &ndash; remember to use wired keyboard or if it is wireless try another 10 times :s. It should work&hellip;hopefully.</p></li>
<li><p>When you are logged in, type in command <code>startx</code> and wait a couple of moments.</p></li>
</ul>


<p> At this point you should see a Raspberry Pi image on your screen.
 To return to command line you can simply hit combination of keys <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Alt</code>+<code>F1</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First things:</p></li>
<li><p>Open up a console again, either locating it on the screen (LXTerminal) or with <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Alt</code>+<code>F1</code> key combination.</p></li>
<li>On-screen keyboard similar to the one in Windows:
<code>sudo apt-get install matchbox-keyboard</code></li>
<li>Safely eject USB drive command:
<code>sudo apt-get install eject</code></li>
<li>Safely shutdown Raspberry Pi
<code>sudo shutdown -t 1 now</code> and reboot <code>sudo shutdown -r now</code></li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s it!</p>

<hr />

<p>F.A.Q.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>If I unplug a USB device from Raspberry Pi, it restarts!</em></li>
</ul>


<p> This is an expected behavior. It is called &lsquo;<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=23205" title="Rush-in current problem">the rush in current problem</a>&rsquo;.
 Only use USB hub for plugging in devices that you are going to remove often. Otherwise a sudden voltage spikes will cause Raspberry Pi to reboot.
 That is why USB hub should have power on.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>I plug in Raspberry to HDMI monitor and see nothing :(</em></li>
</ul>


<p> If you are installing Raspian, try hitting <code>2</code> (safe mode).
 Otherwise <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=34061" title="HDMI connection issue">switch to a different monitor</a>, or use an analog cable.</p>
